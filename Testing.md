## Aim of the Project
### The aim of this project is to successfully deploy a web app on a browser by building a CI/CD pipeline on Jenkins.
Task:
- Fix bugs on the python app and test using TTD on Pytest 
- Push to Dev branch on github 
- Build a Jenkins server on an EC2 instance on AWS
- Create a webhook and first job in the pipeline is to test the git commit and merge to main branch (pytest has to pass)
- Create an AWS environment to run the app
- Containerise the app and upload image to dockerhub 
- Create an EC2 instance to run the containerised app
- Check app is available on browser
- Generate HAR file to generate Scala script to run gatling tests
- Create a Gatling Instance 
- Monitor using CloudWatch and Grafana 
- Create an S3 bucket with the CSV file for disaster recovery
- Create a webhook trigger to send emails once a docker image is uploaded to the repo

# Gatling 

- Script based performance testing tool
- Uses Scala to write the tests
- Used for Heavy Load Testing
- Can easily be hooked into CI/CD Jenkins pipeline
- Less RAM and CPU utilisation

## Steps to Install Gatling 

1. Download Gatling open source on c drive - https://gatling.io/
2. Install Scala as a plugin on IntelliJ
3. Install Java JDK (8 or above) - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows
4. Copy Java bin path into PATH system variable
5. Copy Java path into JAVA_HOME variable
6. Check version â€“ Java -version
7. Run gatling.bat

## Generating HAR file

1. On your website > f12 > Developer tools > Network
2. Record your interaction with the website
3. Export HAR file
4. Open recorder.bat from terminal
5. Recorder mode > HAR Converter
6. Look for HAR file previously exported
7. Run gatling.bat and select option for the file exported
8. Gatling test IP given


# Creating Gatling Testing Server
1. Create an EC2 instance on Ubuntu 18.04 with t2 micro allowing all traffic for the security group
2. SSH into EC2 instance 
3. Run the following commands to install java and gatling:
```bash
#!bin/bash
---
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt install default-jre -y
sudo apt install unzip -y
unzip gatling-charts-highcharts-bundle-3.7.2-bundle.zip
./gatling.sh
sudo nano RecordedSimulation  # har file scala script from duckduckgo/file created in simulations folder
./gatling.sh -s duckduckgo #automatically runs that simualtion


```

## Create Jenkins Testing job
1. Create a new job
2. Build Environment > SSH Agent > SSH username with private key > copy eng99.pem key directly in > Add
3. Build > Execute Shell >
